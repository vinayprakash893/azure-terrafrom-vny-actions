# High-level Code Suggestions ðŸ’Ž

`Supported Git Platforms: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket Cloud, Bitbucket Server`

## Overview
High-level code suggestions, generated by the `improve` tool, offer big-picture code suggestions for your pull request. They focus on broader improvements rather than local fixes, and provide before-and-after code snippets to illustrate the recommended changes and guide implementation.

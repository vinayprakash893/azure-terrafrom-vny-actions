## Overview

The `help_docs` tool can answer a free-text question based on a git documentation folder.

It can be invoked manually by commenting on any PR or Issue:

```
/help_docs "..."
```

Or configured to be triggered automatically when a [new issue is opened](#run-as-a-github-action).

The tool assumes by default that the documentation is located in the root of the repository, at `/docs` folder.
However, this can be customized by setting the `docs_path` configuration option:

```toml
[pr_help_docs]
repo_url = ""                 # The repository to use as context
docs_path = "docs"            # The documentation folder
repo_default_branch = "main"  # The branch to use in case repo_url overwritten

```

See more configuration options in the [Configuration options](#configuration-options) section.

## Example usage

[//]: # (#### Asking a question about this repository:)

[//]: # (![help_docs on the documentation of this repository]&#40;https://codium.ai/images/pr_agent/help_docs_comment.png&#41;{width=512})

**Asking a question about another repository**

![help_docs on the documentation of another repository](https://codium.ai/images/pr_agent/help_docs_comment_explicit_git.png){width=512}

**Response**:

![help_docs response](https://codium.ai/images/pr_agent/help_docs_response.png){width=512}

## Run automatically when a new issue is opened

You can configure PR-Agent to run `help_docs` automatically on any newly created issue.
This can be useful, for example, for providing immediate feedback to users who open issues with questions on open-source projects with extensive documentation.

Here's how:

1) Follow the steps depicted under [Run as a Github Action](https://qodo-merge-docs.qodo.ai/installation/github/#run-as-a-github-action) to create a new workflow, such as:`.github/workflows/help_docs.yml`:

2) Edit your yaml file to the following:

```yaml
name: Run pr agent on every opened issue, respond to user comments on an issue

#When the action is triggered
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened] #New issue

# Read env. variables
env:
  GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  GITHUB_API_URL: ${{ github.api_url }}
  GIT_REPO_URL: ${{ github.event.repository.clone_url }}
  ISSUE_URL: ${{ github.event.issue.html_url || github.event.comment.html_url }}
  ISSUE_BODY: ${{ github.event.issue.body || github.event.comment.body }}
  OPENAI_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_KEY }}

# The actual set of actions
jobs:
  issue_agent:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: ${{ github.event.sender.type != 'Bot' }} #Do not respond to bots

    # Set required permissions
    permissions:
      contents: read    # For reading repository contents
      issues: write     # For commenting on issues

    steps:
      - name: Run PR Agent on Issues
        if: ${{ env.ISSUE_URL != '' }}
        uses: docker://codiumai/pr-agent:latest
        with:
          entrypoint: /bin/bash #Replace invoking cli.py directly with a shell
          args: |
            -c "cd /app && \
            echo 'Running Issue Agent action step on ISSUE_URL=$ISSUE_URL' && \
            export config__git_provider='github' && \
                        export github__user_token=$GITHUB_TOKEN && \
            export github__base_url=$GITHUB_API_URL && \
            export openai__key=$OPENAI_KEY && \
            python -m pr_agent.cli --issue_url=$ISSUE_URL --pr_help_docs.repo_url="..." --pr_help_docs.docs_path="..." --pr_help_docs.openai_key=$OPENAI_KEY && \
            help_docs "$ISSUE_BODY"
```

3) Following completion of the remaining steps (such as adding secrets and relevant configurations, such as `repo_url` and `docs_path`) merge this change to your main branch.
When a new issue is opened, you should see a comment from `github-actions` bot with an auto response, assuming the question is related to the documentation of the repository.

## Configuration options

Under the section `pr_help_docs`, the [configuration file](https://github.com/Codium-ai/pr-agent/blob/main/pr_agent/settings/configuration.toml#L50) contains options to customize the 'help docs' tool:

- `repo_url`: If not overwritten, will use the repo from where the context came from (issue or PR), otherwise - use the given repo as context.
- `repo_default_branch`: The branch to use in case repo_url overwritten, otherwise - has no effect.
- `docs_path`: Relative path from root of repository (either the one this PR has been issued for, or above repo url).
- `exclude_root_readme`:  Whether or not to exclude the root README file for querying the model.
- `supported_doc_exts` : Which file extensions should be included for the purpose of querying the model.

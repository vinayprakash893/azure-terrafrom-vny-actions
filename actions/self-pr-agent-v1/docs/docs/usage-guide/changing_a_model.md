## Changing a model in PR-Agent

See [here](https://github.com/Codium-ai/pr-agent/blob/main/pr_agent/algo/__init__.py) for a list of supported models in PR-Agent.
The default model of PR-Agent is `GPT-5` from OpenAI.
To use a different model than the default, you need to edit in the [configuration file](https://github.com/Codium-ai/pr-agent/blob/main/pr_agent/settings/configuration.toml#L2) the fields:

```toml
[config]
model = "..."
fallback_models = ["..."]
```

For models and environments not from OpenAI, you might need to provide additional keys and other parameters.
You can give parameters via a configuration file, or from environment variables.

!!! note "Model-specific environment variables"
    See [litellm documentation](https://litellm.vercel.app/docs/proxy/quick_start#supported-llms) for the environment variables needed per model, as they may vary and change over time. Our documentation per-model may not always be up-to-date with the latest changes.
    Failing to set the needed keys of a specific model will usually result in litellm not identifying the model type, and failing to utilize it.

### OpenAI like API
To use an OpenAI like API, set the following in your `.secrets.toml` file:

```toml
[openai]
api_base = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
api_key = "sk-..."
```

or use the environment variables (make sure to use double underscores `__`):

```bash
OPENAI__API_BASE=https://api.openai.com/v1
OPENAI__KEY=sk-...
```

### OpenAI Flex Processing

To reduce costs for non-urgent/background tasks, enable Flex Processing:

```toml
[litellm]
extra_body='{"processing_mode": "flex"}'
```

See [OpenAI Flex Processing docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/flex-processing) for details.

### Azure

To use Azure, set in your `.secrets.toml` (working from CLI), or in the GitHub `Settings > Secrets and variables` (working from GitHub App or GitHub Action):

```toml
[openai]
key = "" # your azure api key
api_type = "azure"
api_version = '2023-05-15'  # Check Azure documentation for the current API version
api_base = ""  # The base URL for your Azure OpenAI resource. e.g. "https://<your resource name>.openai.azure.com"
deployment_id = ""  # The deployment name you chose when you deployed the engine
```

and set in your configuration file:

```toml
[config]
model="" # the OpenAI model you've deployed on Azure (e.g. gpt-4o)
fallback_models=["..."]
```

To use Azure AD (Entra id) based authentication set in your `.secrets.toml` (working from CLI), or in the GitHub `Settings > Secrets and variables` (working from GitHub App or GitHub Action):

```toml
[azure_ad]
client_id = ""  # Your Azure AD application client ID
client_secret = ""  # Your Azure AD application client secret
tenant_id = ""  # Your Azure AD tenant ID
api_base = ""  # Your Azure OpenAI service base URL (e.g., https://openai.xyz.com/)
```

Passing custom headers to the underlying LLM Model API can be done by setting extra_headers parameter to litellm.

```toml
[litellm]
extra_headers='{"projectId": "<authorized projectId >", ...}') #The value of this setting should be a JSON string representing the desired headers, a ValueError is thrown otherwise.
```

This enables users to pass authorization tokens or API keys, when routing requests through an API management gateway.

### Ollama

You can run models locally through either [VLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers/vllm) or [Ollama](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers/ollama)

E.g. to use a new model locally via Ollama, set in `.secrets.toml` or in a configuration file:

```toml
[config]
model = "ollama/qwen2.5-coder:32b"
fallback_models=["ollama/qwen2.5-coder:32b"]
custom_model_max_tokens=128000 # set the maximal input tokens for the model
duplicate_examples=true # will duplicate the examples in the prompt, to help the model to generate structured output

[ollama]
api_base = "http://localhost:11434" # or whatever port you're running Ollama on
```

By default, Ollama uses a context window size of 2048 tokens. In most cases this is not enough to cover pr-agent prompt and pull-request diff. Context window size can be overridden with the `OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH` environment variable. For example, to set the default context length to 8K, use: `OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH=8192 ollama serve`. More information you can find on the [official ollama faq](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#how-can-i-specify-the-context-window-size).

Please note that the `custom_model_max_tokens` setting should be configured in accordance with the `OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH`. Failure to do so may result in unexpected model output.

!!! note "Local models vs commercial models"
    Qodo Merge is compatible with almost any AI model, but analyzing complex code repositories and pull requests requires a model specifically optimized for code analysis.

    Commercial models such as GPT-5, Claude Sonnet, and Gemini have demonstrated robust capabilities in generating structured output for code analysis tasks with large input. In contrast, most open-source models currently available (as of January 2025) face challenges with these complex tasks.

    Based on our testing, local open-source models are suitable for experimentation and learning purposes (mainly for the `ask` command), but they are not suitable for production-level code analysis tasks.
    
    Hence, for production workflows and real-world usage, we recommend using commercial models.

### Hugging Face

To use a new model with Hugging Face Inference Endpoints, for example, set:

```toml
[config] # in configuration.toml
model = "huggingface/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf"
fallback_models=["huggingface/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf"]
custom_model_max_tokens=... # set the maximal input tokens for the model

[huggingface] # in .secrets.toml
key = ... # your Hugging Face api key
api_base = ... # the base url for your Hugging Face inference endpoint
```

(you can obtain a Llama2 key from [here](https://replicate.com/replicate/llama-2-70b-chat/api))

### Replicate

To use Llama2 model with Replicate, for example, set:

```toml
[config] # in configuration.toml
model = "replicate/llama-2-70b-chat:2c1608e18606fad2812020dc541930f2d0495ce32eee50074220b87300bc16e1"
fallback_models=["replicate/llama-2-70b-chat:2c1608e18606fad2812020dc541930f2d0495ce32eee50074220b87300bc16e1"]
[replicate] # in .secrets.toml
key = ...
```

(you can obtain a Llama2 key from [here](https://replicate.com/replicate/llama-2-70b-chat/api))

Also, review the [AiHandler](https://github.com/Codium-ai/pr-agent/blob/main/pr_agent/algo/ai_handler.py) file for instructions on how to set keys for other models.

### Groq

To use Llama3 model with Groq, for example, set:

```toml
[config] # in configuration.toml
model = "llama3-70b-8192"
fallback_models = ["groq/llama3-70b-8192"]
[groq] # in .secrets.toml
key = ... # your Groq api key
```

(you can obtain a Groq key from [here](https://console.groq.com/keys))

### xAI

To use xAI's models with PR-Agent, set:

```toml
[config] # in configuration.toml
model = "xai/grok-2-latest"
fallback_models = ["xai/grok-2-latest"] # or any other model as fallback

[xai] # in .secrets.toml
key = "..." # your xAI API key
```

You can obtain an xAI API key from [xAI's console](https://console.x.ai/) by creating an account and navigating to the developer settings page.

### Vertex AI

To use Google's Vertex AI platform and its associated models (chat-bison/codechat-bison) set:

```toml
[config] # in configuration.toml
model = "vertex_ai/codechat-bison"
fallback_models="vertex_ai/codechat-bison"

[vertexai] # in .secrets.toml
vertex_project = "my-google-cloud-project"
vertex_location = ""
```

Your [application default credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials) will be used for authentication so there is no need to set explicit credentials in most environments.

If you do want to set explicit credentials, then you can use the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable set to a path to a json credentials file.

### Google AI Studio

To use [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) models, set the relevant models in the configuration section of the configuration file:

```toml
[config] # in configuration.toml
model="gemini/gemini-1.5-flash"
fallback_models=["gemini/gemini-1.5-flash"]

[google_ai_studio] # in .secrets.toml
gemini_api_key = "..."
```

If you don't want to set the API key in the .secrets.toml file, you can set the `GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO.GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable.

### Anthropic

To use Anthropic models, set the relevant models in the configuration section of the configuration file:

```toml
[config]
model="anthropic/claude-3-opus-20240229"
fallback_models=["anthropic/claude-3-opus-20240229"]
```

And also set the api key in the .secrets.toml file:

```toml
[anthropic]
KEY = "..."
```

See [litellm](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers/anthropic#usage) documentation for more information about the environment variables required for Anthropic.

### Amazon Bedrock

To use Amazon Bedrock and its foundational models, add the below configuration:

```toml
[config] # in configuration.toml
model="bedrock/anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0"
fallback_models=["bedrock/anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0"]

[aws]
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="..."
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="..."
AWS_REGION_NAME="..."
```

You can also use the new Meta Llama 4 models available on Amazon Bedrock:

```toml
[config] # in configuration.toml
model="bedrock/us.meta.llama4-scout-17b-instruct-v1:0"
fallback_models=["bedrock/us.meta.llama4-maverick-17b-instruct-v1:0"]
```

#### Custom Inference Profiles

To use a custom inference profile with Amazon Bedrock (for cost allocation tags and other configuration settings), add the `model_id` parameter to your configuration:

```toml
[config] # in configuration.toml
model="bedrock/anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0"
fallback_models=["bedrock/anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0"]

[aws]
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="..."
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="..."
AWS_REGION_NAME="..."

[litellm]
model_id = "your-custom-inference-profile-id"
```

The `model_id` parameter will be passed to all Bedrock completion calls, allowing you to use custom inference profiles for better cost allocation and reporting.

See [litellm](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers/bedrock#usage) documentation for more information about the environment variables required for Amazon Bedrock.

### DeepSeek

To use deepseek-chat model with DeepSeek, for example, set:

```toml
[config] # in configuration.toml
model = "deepseek/deepseek-chat"
fallback_models=["deepseek/deepseek-chat"]
```

and fill up your key

```toml
[deepseek] # in .secrets.toml
key = ...
```

(you can obtain a deepseek-chat key from [here](https://platform.deepseek.com))

### DeepInfra

To use DeepSeek model with DeepInfra, for example, set:

```toml
[config] # in configuration.toml
model = "deepinfra/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B"
fallback_models = ["deepinfra/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B"]
[deepinfra] # in .secrets.toml
key = ... # your DeepInfra api key
```

(you can obtain a DeepInfra key from [here](https://deepinfra.com/dash/api_keys))

### Mistral

To use models like Mistral or Codestral with Mistral, for example, set:

```toml
[config] # in configuration.toml
model = "mistral/mistral-small-latest"
fallback_models = ["mistral/mistral-medium-latest"]
[mistral] # in .secrets.toml
key = "..." # your Mistral api key
```

(you can obtain a Mistral key from [here](https://console.mistral.ai/api-keys))

### Codestral

To use Codestral model with Codestral, for example, set:

```toml
[config] # in configuration.toml
model = "codestral/codestral-latest"
fallback_models = ["codestral/codestral-2405"]
[codestral] # in .secrets.toml
key = "..." # your Codestral api key
```

(you can obtain a Codestral key from [here](https://console.mistral.ai/codestral))

### Openrouter

To use model from Openrouter, for example, set:

```toml
[config] # in configuration.toml 
model="openrouter/anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet"
fallback_models=["openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-chat"]
custom_model_max_tokens=20000

[openrouter]  # in .secrets.toml or passed an environment variable openrouter__key
key = "..." # your openrouter api key
```

(you can obtain an Openrouter API key from [here](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys))

### Custom models

If the relevant model doesn't appear [here](https://github.com/Codium-ai/pr-agent/blob/main/pr_agent/algo/__init__.py), you can still use it as a custom model:

1. Set the model name in the configuration file:

```toml
[config]
model="custom_model_name"
fallback_models=["custom_model_name"]
```

2. Set the maximal tokens for the model:

```toml
[config]
custom_model_max_tokens= ...
```

3. Go to [litellm documentation](https://litellm.vercel.app/docs/proxy/quick_start#supported-llms), find the model you want to use, and set the relevant environment variables.

4. Most reasoning models do not support chat-style inputs (`system` and `user` messages) or temperature settings.
To bypass chat templates and temperature controls, set `config.custom_reasoning_model = true` in your configuration file.

## Dedicated parameters

### OpenAI models

```toml
[config]
reasoning_effort = "medium" # "low", "medium", "high"
```

With the OpenAI models that support reasoning effort (eg: o4-mini), you can specify its reasoning effort via `config` section. The default value is `medium`. You can change it to `high` or `low` based on your usage.

### Anthropic models

```toml
[config]
enable_claude_extended_thinking = false # Set to true to enable extended thinking feature
extended_thinking_budget_tokens = 2048
extended_thinking_max_output_tokens = 4096
```

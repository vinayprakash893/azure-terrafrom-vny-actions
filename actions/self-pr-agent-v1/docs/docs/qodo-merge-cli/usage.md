# Usage Guide for Qodo Merge CLI


## Understanding the Interface

### Why a Structured Table?

The suggestions table serves as the core interface for reviewing and managing AI feedback.

The table provides a structured overview of all suggestions with key metadata.
Users can efficiently prioritize, explore, and implement suggestions through an intuitive workflow.

The interface guides you from high-level overviews to detailed implementation context.
This consistent user-friendly structure streamlines the review process, reducing time from feedback to implementation.

### Navigation Instructions
Use `↑`/`↓` to navigate suggestions, `Enter` to implement, `Space` for multi-select, and `ESC` to exit.

The table includes:

- **Selection** (`○`/`◉`): Multi-selection mode
- **Category**: Security, Performance, General, etc.
- **Impact**: High, Medium, Low importance
- **Suggestion**: Brief description
- **Status**: `✓` implemented, `✗` declined, blank = pending
- **Detail Panel** (if wide enough): Full suggestion text, affected files, impact analysis

## Flow

### Explore the suggestions

You can explore the suggestions in detail before implementing them.
You can view the proposed code changes in a diff format, jump to the relevant code in your IDE, or chat about any suggestion for clarification.

#### Implementation Summary

After the AI completes the implementation, you receive a **structured output** showing detailed results for each suggestion:

- **Status**: `✓ IMPLEMENTED`, `SKIPPED`, or `✗ REJECTED`
- **Suggestion**: Brief description of what was addressed
- **Reasoning**: Explanation of the implementation approach
- **Changes**: Summary of code modifications made

![Next Actions](https://www.qodo.ai/images/pr_agent/qm_cli_impl_success_next_actions.png){width=768}

Each suggestion gets its own implementation summary, providing full transparency into what was done and why.

### Finalize

After implementing the suggestions, you have several options to proceed:

!!! note "Post Implementation Actions"
    === "Return to Table (`ESC`)"
    
        ![Status Updates](https://www.qodo.ai/images/pr_agent/qm_cli_suggestion_status_update_add_v_sign.png){width=768}
        
        The first option returns you to the main table where you can see:
        
        - **Updated Status**: Implemented suggestions now show `✓` green checkmark
          - **Real-time Updates**: Status changes reflect immediately
          - **Continue Workflow**: Handle remaining pending suggestions
    
    === "Continue Chatting (`C`)"
    
        ![Continue Chat](https://www.qodo.ai/images/pr_agent/qm_cli_continue_chat.png){width=768}

        - Review changes made by the AI
        - Request refinements or modifications
        - Get explanations of implementation approach
        - Continuous improvement cycle
    
    === "Commit Changes (`M`)"

        - Standard git conventions
        - Seamless workflow integration
    
    === "Open Edited File (`O`)"
    
        Open the implemented code directly in your IDE:
        
        - View the exact changes made
        - See implementation in full context
        - Continue development seamlessly
        - Integrated with your existing workflow

## Tips for Success

- **Start with "Fix All"** to let AI handle everything intelligently
- **Use Chat liberally** - ask questions about unclear suggestions
- **Decline appropriately** - press `X` and provide reasons for inappropriate suggestions
- **Multi-select strategically** - group related suggestions together
